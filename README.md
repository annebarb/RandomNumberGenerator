#### Description
The numeric system represented by Roman numerals originated in ancient Rome and remained the usual way of writing numbers throughout Europe well into the Late Middle Ages. Roman numerals, as used today, employ seven symbols, each with a fixed integer value.

See the below table the Symbol - Value pairs:

- I - 1
- V - 5
- X - 10
- L - 50
- C - 100
- D - 500
- M - 1000

### User Stories
- [ ] User should be able to enter one Roman number in an input field
- [ ] User could see the results in a single output field containing the decimal (base 10) equivalent of the roman number that was entered by pressing a button
- [ ] If a wrong symbol is entered, the User should see an error

### Bonus features
